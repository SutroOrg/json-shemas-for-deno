JSON Schemas for Deno developers

Importing the official schema files fails, because they don't have the standard JSON MIME-type, so this is another way to retrieve them

Each schema is also available as a `.ts` file, in case you're on a version of Deno that doesn't support import assertions

## Available Schemas

- JSON Schema
  - draft/2020-12
  - draft/2019-09
  - draft-07
